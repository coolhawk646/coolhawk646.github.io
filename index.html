<p>I make gaming videos for youtube. Leave a like and subscribe for awesome videos :D You should subscribe to me because you will never get bored, I upload a lot so you will always have videos to watch. I do my best to make my videos as awesome as possible. I am always trying to improve my video quality every day, like getting the best microphone and the best screen recorders (I have the Camtasia screen recorder and a Presonus microphone) . My goal is to bring new content to my channel, like new games and stuff to talk about( #Cool Hawk talk). So if you like dedicated youtubers, then watch my videos and subscribe!!!!</p>
